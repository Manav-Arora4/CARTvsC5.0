# CART vs. C5.0: Decision Tree Model Comparison

## Overview
This repository presents a comparative analysis of two decision tree models:  
- **CART (Classification and Regression Trees)** implemented in Python  
- **C5.0 Decision Tree Algorithm** implemented in R  

The project was developed as part of a **university assignment**, with the **C5.0 R script generated using the LLM Claude**. It explores **model implementation, preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, visualization, and evaluation metrics** to determine which algorithm performs better on a given dataset.

## Contents
- **`CART.ipynb`** – Jupyter Notebook implementing the CART model in Python.
- **`C5.0.R`** – R script implementing the C5.0 model.
- **`CART_vs_C5.0_Report.pdf`** – A detailed report analyzing model performance, feature importance, and preprocessing steps.

## Dataset
The **UCI Credit Card dataset** is used in this project. It contains financial and demographic information on credit card holders, with the target variable being **`default.payment.next.month`**, which indicates whether a customer defaults on their payment.
